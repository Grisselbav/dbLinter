The rules page is the only public page. This means this page can be accessed without a dbLinter account.

This page shows the same content as the [Static Rule Site](https://dblinter-rules.united-codes.com/all-rules/).
However, the Static Rule Site shows only the public rules of the `Core` tenant. Tenant-specific rules are
only visible here and only if you are signed in.

## Get started with VS Code

When you are signed in, you will see this extra header.
