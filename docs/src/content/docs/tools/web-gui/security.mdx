| Starter (Free)    | View, Config, Check, Test, VSCode |

| Professional      | View, Config, Check, Test, VSCode, FullScope, QuickFix, CLI, Users, SonarQube, Rules, GenJava, GenUtPLSQL, Plugin, Export, Import |

### Role Features

To simplify access management for users and access tokens, features are grouped into roles.

| Role            | Features |
| --------------- | -------- |
| Access-Request  | (none)<sup>1</sup> |
| DB-Developer    | View, Check, Test, VSCode, FullScope, QuickFix, CLI |
| Configurator    | View, Config |
| Rules-Developer | View, Rules, GenJava, GenUtPLSQL, Plugin |
| Transporter     | View, Export, Import |
| Tenant-Admin    | View, Config, Check, Test, VSCode, FullScope, QuickFix, CLI, Users, SonarQube, Rules, GenJava, GenUtPLSQL, Plugin, Export, Import |

<sup>1</sup> The Access-Request role is temporary. It is assigned when access to a tenant is requested.

### Applicability

The applicable roles are calculated at runtime according to the assigned roles and the active subscriptions of the selected tenant.
Features are only available if they are included in the active subscriptions.

This is why a user with the Tenant-Admin role of a free starter subscription only has access to the features included in that subscription.
