The dbLinter Web GUI is used for managing tenant-specific data,
such as rules, configurations and user access.

It can be reached via https://dblinter.app. As an anonymous user, you can view all the public rules.

## Create a Free dbLinter Account

In order to manage configurations, such as enabling or disabling rules and setting their parameters, a dbLinter account is required.

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>
1. Open the [Web GUI login dialog](https://dblinter.app/ords/r/dblinter/dblinter-console/login) and click on `Sign up`.
2. Enter your `E-mail address` and `Display name` and click on `Send token`.
3. Check your e-mails and copy the confirmation token into the clipboard and paste it into the `Confirm sign-up` dialog. Enter a password (twice) and click on `Confirm`.
</Steps>

Once you have completed the registration process, you will have a free tenant with
a `Default` configuration that you can customise to suit your needs.
