This command runs SQL-based tests using a configuration that is defined in the Web GUI.
This feature is only available with an [Essential](/dbLinter/getting-started/essential-subscription/)
or [Professional Subscription](/dbLinter/getting-started/professional-subscription/).

## Syntax

```
dblinter [<options>] test [<args>]
```

## Options

See [Options](/dbLinter/tools/cli/options/).
Mandatory options are `tenantName`, `userName`, `accessToken` and `configName`.
If the JDBC connection has not been fully configured via the Web GUI,
the following options are also mandatory: `connJdbcUrl`, `connUserName` and `connPassword`.

## Argument Syntax

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="in Command Line">
```
--<argument>=<value>
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="in Property File">
```
<argument>=<value>
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Arguments

In dbLinter, both arguments and options are treated in the same way.
Therefore, they can be used in any order. For example, they can be used before or after the command name.
We use options when the semantics are identical for each applicable command.
Arguments are used when the semantics change for a command.

- `outputFormats`<br/>
    A comma-separated list of the output formats to be produced.
    All formats are considered by default.
    The following formats are supported:<br/>
        - `vscode`: dbLinter Test Report as Markdown for VS Code. This report will open automatically when the analysis is run via the VS Code extension.
        - `junit`: [JUnit](https://llg.cubic.org/docs/junit/) XML Report.
    <br/>

- `outputName`<br/>
    This is the relative path from the working directory to the base name of the output files.
    Missing target directories will be created.
    For example, if you use the name `test` for an `outputName`, a file called `test.vscode.md` will be created in the working directory.
    The default is `dblinter`.

- `parallel`<br/>
    The number of SQL-based tests executed in parallel
    The default is `1`.

## Example

```bash
dbLinter test \
    --tenantName=Demo \
    --userName=philipp.salvisberg+42@gmail.com \
    --accessToken=*** \
    --configName=Default \
    --outputFormats=vscode,junit \
    --outputName=test \
    --parallel=2
```

The console output for the [dbLinter-Demo](https://github.com/Grisselbav/dbLinter-Demo) project on GitHub looks like this:
