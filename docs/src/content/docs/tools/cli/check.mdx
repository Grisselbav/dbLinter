```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="in Property File">
```

</Tabs>

## Arguments

When calling dbLinter, the order of the arguments and options is flexible.
In other words, the command name can appear either at the beginning or the end.

- `outputFormats`<br/>
    A comma-separated list of the output formats to be produced.
    All formats are considered by default.
    The following formats are supported:<br/>
        - `vscode`: dbLinter Check Report as Markdown for VS Code. This report will open automatically when the analysis is run via the VS Code extension.
        - `sonarqube`: [SonarQube](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/2025.1/analyzing-source-code/importing-external-issues/generic-issue-import-format/) Generic formatted issue report to import issues in any SonarQube edition without any plugin.
        - `sarif`: Static Analysis Results Interchange Format ([SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/errata01/os/sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-os-complete.html)) to visualise issues in various tools. See also [Viewers](https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/#Viewers).
        - `checkstyle`: [Checkstyle](https://github.com/linkedin/pygradle/blob/master/pygradle-plugin/src/test/resources/checkstyle/checkstyle.xsd) XML report.
        - `github`: [Workflow commands for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-commands). These commands (annotations) are interpreted when printed to stdout.
        - `gitlab`: [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/testing/code_quality/#code-quality-report-format) quality report.
    <br/>

- `outputName`<br/>
    This is the relative path from the working directory to the base name of the output files.
    Missing target directories will be created.
    For example, if you use the name `check` for an outputName, a file called `check.vscode.md` will be created in the working directory.

- `parallel`<br/>
    The number of files analysed in parallel.
    The default is `1`.
    To achieve better performance with higher values, you need enough free system resources.
    Also consider increasing the maximum heap space using the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable.
    For example, `export JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx=32G` to set the maximum heap size to 32GB.
    The default maximum heap size for a system with 64 GB of RAM is 16 GB (one quarter), which is sensible for desktop systems.
    In CI/CD environments, however, higher values can improve performance, especially when processing large files.

## Example

```bash
dbLinter check \
    --tenantName=Demo \
    --userName=philipp.salvisberg+42@gmail.com \
    --accessToken=*** \
    --configName=Default \
    --outputFormats=vscode,github \
    --outputName=check \
    --parallel=2
```

The console output for the [dbLinter-Demo](https://github.com/Grisselbav/dbLinter-Demo) project on GitHub looks like this:
