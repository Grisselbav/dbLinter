This command starts the language server.

The language server and the client communicate with each other via input and output streams.
In the case of the language server, these are stdin and stdout. Log messages are sent over stderr.

Both the client and the server send and receive [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) messages.
The [supported message types](/dbLinter/reference/architecture/#language-server) are listed in the language Server
section of the architecture chapter.

The language server is designed for use by the dbLinter components, which start and stop it automatically.
You should never need to start the language server manually.

## Syntax

```
dblinter ls
```

## Example

The next shell command sends a `shutdown` message, followed by an `exit` message, via `stdin` to a freshly started dbLinter
language server. It then redirects the `stdout` to the `lsp-stdout.txt` and the `stderr` to the `lsp-stderr.txt`.

```bash
(
    printf "%b" 'Content-Length: 44\n\n{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"shutdown"}'
    printf "%b" 'Content-Length: 33\n\n{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"exit"}'
) | dblinter ls > lsp-stdout.txt 2> lsp-stderr.txt
```

The `lsp-stdout.txt` file contains the result message of the successful shutdown.

```json title="lsp-stdout.txt"
Content-Length: 36

{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{}}
```

And the `lsp-stderr.txt` file contains the log messages produced by the language server.

```log title="lsp-stderr.txt"
2025-12-14 10:41:24.848 [Info ] Starting dbLinter Language Server.
2025-12-14 10:41:25.128 [Info ] connect.
2025-12-14 10:41:25.133 [Info ] shutdown.
```

Currently, all the defaults are active.
Different log formats or log levels are applied after the `workspace/didChangeConfiguration`
message sent by the client has been processed.
