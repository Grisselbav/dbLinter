The CLI is bundled with the VS Code extensions.
The `check` and the `test` commands can be run directly from the UI, eliminating the need for manual input.
This feature is only available with an [Essential](/dbLinter/getting-started/essential-subscription/)
or [Professional Subscription](/dbLinter/getting-started/professional-subscription/).

## Activation

The CLI integration is activated either when you run a check or when you open the dbLinter view container.

Clicking on the dbLinter symbol

![dbLinter symbol](../../../../assets/logo/dbLinter-icon-color.svg)

in the activity bar opens the dbLinter view container. `Command Line` is the second view in this container.

Alternatively, click the run button to the right of the top-level entry `Check`.

Once the `check` command has been completed, the `Check Report` is opened.
