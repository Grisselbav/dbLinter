In VS Code, VSCodium and its forks, you can filter the dbLinter settings with `@ext:Grisselbav.dblinter`.
This happens automatically when you select `Settings` in the Marketplace view's context menu for the the dbLinter extension.

In Theia IDE, which is not a VS Code fork, you need to open the settings via the `File` menu and search for `dbLinter`.

## Scope

In VS Code, settings are scoped to control where they apply.

- `User`<br/>
    User settings apply globally to all projects and folders you open.

- `Workspace`<br/>
    Workspace settings apply only to the current project/workspace and override User settings.

In other words, use `User` settings for preferences you want everywhere, and `Workspace` settings for project-specific behaviour.

## Remote Access

If you have created an account at https://dblinter.app, you can view your options in [How to set up VS Code](https://dblinter.app/ords/r/dblinter/dblinter-console/set-up-vs-code).

- `Repo Url`<br/>
    This is the URL of the dbLinter REST API. The default is https://api.dblinter.app/.
    You only need to change this URL when developing and testing custom rules.
    This requires a [Professional Subscription](/dbLinter/getting-started/professional-subscription/).

- `Tenant Name`<br/>
    The dbLinter tenant used for authentication.
    The default is `Anonymous`.

- `User Name`<br/>
    The dbLinter user name (email address) used for authentication.
    The default is `anonymous@dblinter.app`.

- `Access Token`<br/>
    The personal dbLinter access token used for authentication.
    You can manage the access token in the [Web GUI](https://dblinter.app/ords/r/dblinter/dblinter-console/access-tokens).
    There you define the validity period and the access rights.
    The default is an access token owned by the anonymous user.

- `Config Name`<br/>
    This is the name of the configuration to be used for checks and SQL-based tests.
    This configuration consists of include/exclude file patterns and JDBC connection details.
    It also includes enabled rules, parameters, and test results to be ignored.
    If the tenant name is not specified, the default is `Anonymous`, otherwise, it is `Default`.

    For the Anonymous tenant the following config names are valid:

    | Config Name | Description |
    | ----------- | ----------- |
    | <span style="white-space: nowrap">`Anonymous`</span> | Enables around 50 free rules from the `Essential` and `Balanced` profiles. Which is a reasonable set for any project. |
    | `pg` | A subset of the `Anonymous` configuration which is applicable for PostgreSQL projects. |


## Read-only Access

Read-only access is required for SQL-based tests and optional for checks.
However, to achieve the best results, it is recommended that read-only database access is also defined for checks.

To enable read-only access, you will need to create a database user with the following permissions:

```sql
create user if not exists dbl_read identified by "(...)";
grant connect to dbl_read;
grant select any dictionary to dbl_read;
```

- `Conn Jdbc Url`<br/>
    This is the JDBC URL for read-only database access.
    This option takes precedence over the JDBC URL configured in the Web GUI.
    The language server embedded in the VS Code extension comes with database drivers for Oracle Database and PostgreSQL.
    Therefore, only JDBC URLs valid for these DBMSs will work.
    Here are two examples:
        - `jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521/FREEPDB1`
        - `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres`
    <br/>

- `Conn User Name`<br/>
    The JDBC user for read-only database access.
    This option takes precedence over the JDBC user configured in the Web GUI.

- `Conn Password`<br/>
    This is the password for the JDBC user for accessing the read-only database.
    This option takes precedence over the password configured in the Web GUI.

## Local Language Server

- `Java Bin Directory`<br/>
    This is the name of the directory that contains the `java` executable for a JDK version 17 or higher.
    If this directory is empty, the JDK included with Oracle SQL Developer for VS Code is used instead.
    Otherwise, if this extension is not installed, the `java` executable must be found in the operating system's path.
    A restart or `reload window` is required for the changes to take effect.

- `Log Level`<br/>
    This is the log level used to write log messages to output panel of dbLinter and to log files when running CLI commands.
    The following levels are valid:<br/>
        - `error`: Log only errors.
        - `warning`: Log only warnings and errors.
        - `info`: Log only info messages, warnings and errors. This is the default.
        - `debug`: Log only debug messages, info messages, warnings and errors.
        - `trace`: Log all messages. This level helps developers diagnose the root cause of a problem. It also includes profiling information for parsing and checking operations that can slow overall performance.
    <br/>

- `Parallel Files`<br/>
    The number of files analysed in parallel when using the CLI.
    The default is `1`.
    This setting is not used by the language server started by VS Code in order to minimise the resource consumption.

- `Parallel SQL`<br/>
    The number of SQL-based tests executed in parallel when using the CLI.
    The default is `1`.

- `Clear Cache Threshold`<br/>
    Memory threshold in megabytes.
    The ANTLR caches are cleared once the heap size used by the language server exceeds this threshold.
    While this frees up memory, subsequent parsing is slower.
    Set the threshold to a negative value to retain the cache.
    The cache is only cleared when analysing a file.
    This setting only applies to the language server started by VS Code, rather than those started by CLI calls.

- `Enable Remote Debugging`<br/>
    Enable remote JVM debugging.
    When this option is enabled, VS Code is restricted to a single instance because the debugging port cannot be shared.
    Requires a restart or `reload window` to take effect.
    This setting only applies to the language server started by VS Code, rather than those started by CLI calls.

- `Remote Debugging Port`<br/>
    JVM debugging port.
    Used when remote JVM debugging is enabled.
    Requires a restart or `reload window` to take effect.
    This setting only applies to the language server started by VS Code, rather than those started by CLI calls.
