The dbLinter VS Code Extension provides rule violations and quick fixes for given URIs via the included language server.
It further can run SQL-based tests and CLI commands.

The extension can be installed in any IDE that implement the [Visual Studio Code Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api).

This are primarily IDEs based on [Code OSS](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). Another option instead of forking [Code OSS](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) is to implement
the [Visual Studio Code Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api) from scratch.

The list below shows IDEs that run locally on a developer's machine. These IDEs have been successfully tested with dbLinter.

## Settings

The default settings are for an anonymous subscription plan.
This means that only around 50 rules are active.
These are the free rules from the `Essential` and `Balanced` profiles.
Which is a reasonable set for any project using an Oracle Database.

To configure the set of rules to be applied, you need at least a [Starter Subscription (Free)](/dbLinter/getting-started/starter-subscription/).
