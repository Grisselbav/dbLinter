The dbLinter SonarQube plugin is used by the [SonarQube Scanner](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/analyzing-source-code/scanners/sonarscanner)
to analyse code and show the results on the SonarQube Server web application.

The plugin can be installed in the free [SonarQube Community Build](https://www.sonarsource.com/open-source-editions/sonarqube-community-edition/)
as well as in any commercial [SonarQube Server](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/server/) edition.

Releases of the dbLinter SonarQube plugin will be published the [Releases](https://github.com/Grisselbav/dbLinter/releases) section of the dbLinter GitHub repository.

We plan to make this plugin available in February 2026.
