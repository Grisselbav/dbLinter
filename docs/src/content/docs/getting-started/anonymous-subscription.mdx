## Rule Set

The Anonymous plan is active when you use the dbLinter VS Code extension without setting up an dbLinter account.
Only those rules that should be applicable to any project without any configuration are enabled in this plan.

See [Rules](/dbLinter/#rules) for details.

:::note[Oracle Database Support]
By default, the rules are configured for projects using an Oracle Database.

:::tip[PostgreSQL Support]
Set the `dbLinter Config Name` setting to `pg` to enable the subset of rules that are applicable for PostgreSQL projects.
