## Create a dbLinter Account

Create a dbLinter account using your business e-mail address. You can skip this step,
if you have already created such an account for a Starter or Essential subscription.

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>
1. Open the [Web-GUI login dialog](https://preview.dblinter.app/ords/r/dblinter/dblinter-console/login) and click on `Sign up`.
2. Enter your `E-mail address` and `Display name` and click on `Send token`.
3. Check your e-mails and copy the confirmation token into the clipboard and paste it into the `Confirm sign-up` dialog. Enter a password (twice) and click on `Confirm`.
</Steps>

## Order a dbLinter Tenant

In the last step, you set up a personal free tenant. For a professional subscription you need to order a dedicated tenant.
Your business e-mail address will be registered as administrator.

The the following information is needed:

import { Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Tenant Name" icon="seti:favicon">
    Identifies a tenant uniquely within a dbLinter repository.
    For example a company name. The tenant name is case-insensitive.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Number of Seats" icon="setting">
    Total number of developers and technical users (for CI/CD pipelines).
    Moreover, the number of seats is equivalent to the maximum number of concurrent dbLinter sessions for a tenant.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

The subscription fee is calculated on the basis of the number of seats.

import { LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
