## Frequently Aked Questions

### What is a seat?

A 'seat' is a is a licensing unit used by dbLinter.

The number of licensed seats determines the maximum number of users that can be registered for a tenant.

Furthermore, a seat is reserved for each unique combination of the following attributes of a client session:

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| <span style="white-space: nowrap">Email address</span> | The email address of the dbLinter user used to connect to the dbLinter REST API. |
| IP address | The public IP address used to connect to the dbLinter REST API. |
| MAC address | The first enabled MAC address of the client machine. This may change when switching between network connections. |
| OS user | The operating system user name used to connect to the dbLinter REST API. |

This definition enables an unlimited number of tools to open client sessions on a single machine, with only one seat reserved.

### Who opens a client session?

| Tool | Open Session Event |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| dbLinter VS Code Extension | On activation of the extension. |
|  | On session expiration while running checks or tests. |
| dbLinter CLI | On start of a check command. |
|          | On start of a test command. |
| SonarScanner | On start of a check run using the dbLinter SonarQube plugin. |

### Who closes a client session?

| Tool | Close Session Event |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| dbLinter VS Code Extension | On closing VS Code. |
|  | On reload window. |
| dbLinter CLI | On send of a check command. |
|          | On end of a test command. |
| SonarScanner | On end of a check run using the dbLinter SonarQube plugin. |
| dbLinter Repo | On expiration of a client session. This is a logical change based on the server time. No update is necessary to handle this event. |

### What is the TTL of a client session?

This is configured in the dbLinter Repo per tenant.
The default value is 1800 seconds.
The value can only be changed by a product administrator.

### Is it allowed to use access tokens of another user?

No.
Access tokens are personal.
They must not be shared between natural persons.

### What happens when the number of seats is exceeded?

| Tool | Impact |
| ---- | ------ |
| dbLinter VS Code Extension | An error is logged. Problems are no longer being reported. SQL-based tests cannot be run. Neither can CLI commands. |
| dbLinter CLI | An error is logged and CLI stops with an error. |
| SonarScanner | An error is logged and SonarScanner stops with an error. |

### Feature is not enabled for the current access token. Why?

This error message is produced by the language server.
This occurs when the access token does not have the necessary dbLinter roles to run the requested operation.
The same thing happens when an error occurs when reading the configuration, resulting in no roles being found for the access token.

Check the logs for errors.

Typical root causes are:
- Invalid [Remote Access](http://localhost:4321/dbLinter/tools/vscode/settings/#remote-access) settings.
- Exceeded number of seats.

### At what point is the configuration read?

The configuration is read from the dbLinter repo when opening a client session.
