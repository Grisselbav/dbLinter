## Cloud Components

Cloud components are installed on servers managed by United Codes and Grisselbav.

### Repo

The dbLinter repository is implemented using the [PinkDB paradigm](https://www.salvis.com/blog/2018/07/18/the-pink-database-paradigm-pinkdb/)
with an [Oracle AI Database 26ai](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/index.html).
For example, this means that the [Web GUI](#web-gui) and the [REST-API](#rest-api) access the database via dedicated users
based on the [principle of least privileges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege).

### Web GUI

The dbLiner Web GUI is built with [Oracle APEX](https://apex.oracle.com/en/). It is used for managing tenant-specific data,
such as rules, configurations and user access.

For more information, see [Web GUI](/dbLinter/tools/web-gui) in the Tools section.

### REST-API

The dbLinter REST-API is a [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application. It is an internal API
used only by other dbLinter components. The following subjects are covered:

| Subject | Communication via | Description                                                                     |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email   | JMS               | Sending e-mails synchronously and asynchronously via Oracle AQ and Spring Mail. |
| Rules   | REST              | Providing the rules for generating the static rules site.                       |
| Config  | REST              | Get the configuration required to run checks and SQL-based tests.               |
| Ignore  | REST              | Add tests to be ignored to prevent them from being reported in subsequent runs. |

All REST-API calls require authentication using an API key consisting of the tenant name, the user's email address and a personal access token.

### Static Rule Site

The dbLinter static rule site is generated daily with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) using the latest public rules from the dbLinter repository.
This website makes the dbLinter rules available independently of the dbLinter tool suite.

This static rule site is used to reference the rules in the `Problems` panel in the [VS Code Extension](#vs-code-extension)
and in reports produced by the [CLI](#cli).

## Local Components

Local components run on machines controlled by the dbLinter users.

### Language Server

The dbLinter Language Server implements a subset of [Microsoft's Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/)
using [Eclipse LSP4J](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.lsp4j). The Language Server is embedded in the [CLI](#cli) and the [SonarQube Plugin](#sonarqube-plugin).

The following LSP methods are implemented:

- [initialize](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#initialize)
- [shutdown](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#shutdown)
- [exit](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#exit)
- [setTrace](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#setTrace) (empty implementation)
- [workspace/didChangeConfiguration](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workspace_didChangeConfiguration)
- [workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workspace_didChangeWatchedFiles) (empty implementation)
- [textDocument/diagnostic](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_diagnostic)
- [textDocument/didOpen](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_didOpen)
- [textDocument/didChange](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_didChange)
- [textDocument/didClose](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_didClose)
- [textDocument/didSave](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_didSave) (empty implementation)
- [textDocument/codeAction](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_codeAction)
- [codeAction/resolve](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#codeAction_resolve)

Additionally, the Language Server implements the following non-standard JSON-RPC methods used by other dbLinter components:

| Method                     | Description                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dbLinter/tests             | Get all SQL-based tests that are part of the configuration.               |
| dbLinter/runTest           | Run a SQL-based test.                                                     |
| dbLinter/ignoreTestResults | Save test results to be ignored in the configuration.                     |
| dbLinter/hasFeature        | Check if a dbLinter feature is available.                                 |
| dbLinter/isConfigLoaded    | Check if the configuration is loaded.                                     |
| dbLinter/isUriIncluded     | Checks if a given URI should be processed according to the configuration. |
| dbLinter/plsqlMetric       | Get the PL/SQL metrics for a given URI.                                   |
| dbLinter/rules             | Get the rules defined in the configuration.                               |
