## Cloud Components

Cloud components are installed on servers managed by United Codes and Grisselbav.

### Repo

The dbLinter repository is implemented using the [PinkDB paradigm](https://www.salvis.com/blog/2018/07/18/the-pink-database-paradigm-pinkdb/)
with an [Oracle AI Database 26ai](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/26/index.html).
For example, this means that the [Web GUI](#web-gui) and the [REST-API](#rest-api) access the database via dedicated users
based on the [principle of least privileges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege).

### Web GUI

The dbLiner Web GUI is built with [Oracle APEX](https://apex.oracle.com/en/). It is used for managing tenant-specific data,
such as rules, configurations and user access.

For more information, see [Web GUI](../../tools/web-gui) in the Tools section.

### REST-API

The dbLinter REST-API is a [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application. The following services are provided:

| Subject | Communication via | Description                                                                     |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email   | JMS               | Sending e-mails synchronously and asynchronously via Oracle AQ and Spring Mail. |
| Rules   | REST              | Providing the rules for generating the static rules site.                       |
| Config  | REST              | Get the configuration required to run checks and SQL-based tests.               |
| Ignore  | REST              | Add tests to be ignored to prevent them from being reported in subsequent runs. |

All REST-API calls require authentication using an API key consisting of the tenant name, the user's email address and a personal access token.

### Static Rule Site

The dbLinter static rule site is generated daily with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) using the latest public rules from the dbLinter repository.
This website makes the dbLinter rules available independently of the dbLinter tool suite.

This static rule site is used to reference the rules in the `Problems` panel in the [VS Code Extension](#vs-code-extension)
and in reports produced by the [CLI](#cli).
