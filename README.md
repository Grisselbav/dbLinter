# dbLinter

## Introduction

dbLinter is a suite for checking and improving the quality of database applications.
Quality is assessed using static code analysis and database queries based on a configuration.
A configuration is primarily centrally managed in the [dbLinter Web GUI](https://dblinter.app/).
It contains file patterns, rules, validators, SQL-based tests, parameters, and connect information for read-only database access within checks and tests.

dbLinter is a joint project between United Codes and Grisselbav.
You can get commercial subscription plans through United Codes.
See the [dbLinter product site](https://www.united-codes.com/products/dblinter/) for details.
